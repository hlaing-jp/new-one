## Best Examples of User Documentation
### Leave a comment / Documentation, Helpdesk / By Justin Kumor

User Documentation, also known as End-user Documentation, refers to the documentation for a product or service provided to the end users. It aims in providing information about the product. Also, this is often referred to as user assistance.

It could be based on a product or a service provided or a complete end to the end project documentation, that directly helps the end user.

Technically speaking, a useful user document should have all documentation and essentials that are required and related to the entire product cycle. The user documentation is a part of the overall product delivered to the customer; end-to-end.

It starts from the initiation phase to the closure, ie, end to end product life cycle.
